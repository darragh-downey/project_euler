# Problem 20: Factorial digit sum

### Problem Description
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800,
and the sum of the digits in the number 10! is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!


### Solution 1: Brute Force!
Throw everything at it

### Solution 2: Memoization!!
With factorials, you compute the same values multiple times as:

10! = 10 x 9!
